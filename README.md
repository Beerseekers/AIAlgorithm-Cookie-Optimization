# AIAlgorithm-Cookie-Optimization
A project done during the first semester of 2024-2025 for my AI Algorithm class. Work done by Thomas Daniel, Th√©o Chichery and me (Jean Marchegay). The aim was to solve an optimization problem using different methods presented to us during classes. We implemented a wide variety of methods ranging from search algorithms to genetic approaches and dynamic programming.
