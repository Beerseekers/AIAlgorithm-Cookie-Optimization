    "  - May fail to optimize beyond the first valid solution without additional mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Dynamic Programming (DP)\n",
    "Dynamic Programming was employed to solve the problem by breaking it into overlapping subproblems. This approach focused on finding optimal placements using a table-driven methodology to store intermediate results.\n",

    "Each algorithm showcased unique advantages and trade-offs. While A* delivered precise and high-value solutions, it struggled with scalability for larger rolls. GA and ACO, by contrast, demonstrated adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios but required careful parameter tuning and computational resources. CSP proved excellent for strict constraints but lacked the depth to explore innovative placements. DP excelled in solving structured problems optimally but faced limitations with memory requirements for larger scales.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deciding on a Unified Design**: We spent considerable time determining how to structure the implementation in a way that would accommodate different search algorithms without requiring frequent changes. Ultimately, we settled on a straightforward approach using arrays and classes, which enabled efficient global management of elements. We decided to tweak the implementation a bit for the nature inspired algorithms to make it easier for them as they were computationally heavy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Errors**: The handling of errors evolved significantly throughout the project. Initially, we experimented with several methods before deciding on rounding errors down to the nearest integer for simplicity. In the context of genetic algorithms, we implemented errors as a dictionary, allowing easier and more efficient data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Due to the problem's vast number of possibilities and the large roll size, many algorithms proved too time-consuming to be practical. For instance, the A* algorithm was adapted to return only 500 results and terminate early instead of waiting for the entire frontier to be processed. We also leveraged external libraries like OR-Tools to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assessing Algorithm Effectiveness**: Since the maximum possible result wasn’t predefined, it was challenging to gauge an algorithm's success at first glance. To address this, we prioritized the A* algorithm initially for its structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Limitations**: Some algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, struggled to find optimal solutions due to insufficient diversity. These algorithms often became trapped in local maxima, optimizing early but failing to explore alternative solutions with better potential in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improving Efficiency**: Algorithms like A* could benefit from more precise node management to reduce runtime without compromising accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Achieving Optimal Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reaching the Maximum**: Certain algorithms were unable to reach the known best result (715). It would be worthwhile to experiment with more refined hyperparameter tuning and models architectures (GA) to see if achieving this maximum is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided a hands-on opportunity to explore and test various algorithms in a practical scenario, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, it required us to go beyond the classroom, experimenting with algorithms we hadn’t previously studied. Finally, implementing the project from the ground up taught us to approach problems with a long-term perspective, ensuring that our implementation could support diverse algorithmic needs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations:\n",
    "- **Hybrid Models**: Combining A* for initial optimal placements with GA or ACO for iterative refinement could leverage the strengths of each approach.\n",
    "- **Parameter Optimization**: Employ grid search or machine learning techniques to automate parameter tuning for GA and ACO.\n",
    "- **Scenario-Specific Strategies**: Use CSP for tightly constrained problems, DP for structured, overlapping subproblem scenarios, and GA or ACO for open-ended, large-scale tasks.\n"
